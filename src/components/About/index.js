            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p className="paragraph-animate">
              Hello! I'm Noah Roberts, a Computer Science graduate from at Iowa
              State University, class of 2025. My journey into the world of
              technology began in 2012 at a summer coding camp, sparking an my
              interest in this field. From learning how to build my first
              computer, coming up with new projects, to teaching myself a new
              language or framework, I'm always trying to improve my skills.
            </p>
            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p className="paragraph-animate">
              When im not immersed in my work or coding, I enjoy working out at
              the gym, watching football, bartending, and listening to music.
              Some of my favorite bands are Pink Floyd, Pearl Jam, and
              Metallica. I believe in the importance of maintaining a balanced
              lifestyle. Time management is a personal necessity that allows me
              to juggle my personal responsibilities, projects, and social life.
            </p>
            <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
            <p className="paragraph-animate">
              Now entering the next chapter of my journey, Iâ€™m seeking full-time
              opportunities where I can apply my skills to solve meaningful
              problems and continue growing as a developer.
            </p>
